## Assignment 4
Due Date: April 15, 2021

## Student Information
* Name: Rabia Qureshi
* Student ID: 1046427
* E-mail: rqureshi@uoguelph.ca

## Notes for Grader
* Rename Component functionality from A3 gives route the wrong name, but the database updates the route name (database connection is there)
* Execute Query dropdown only works as expected if user hits the "Store Files" button in the "Store All Files" panel upon login
* 'Clear Data' and 'Add Route' buttons will reload the page, which means you will have to login again if you wish to access the database
