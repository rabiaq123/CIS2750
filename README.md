Professor Nikitenko said to add any necessary notes for the TA to help them navigate the web app easily and avoid losing marks for unexpected behaviour due to the limited time for marking.

Thank you in advance for reading!
* For Execute Query commands to work as expected, the user must hit the 'Store Files' button before selecting an option from the 'Execute Query' dropdown.
* 'Clear Data', 'Add Route', and 'Rename Route' buttons will reload the page, which means you will have to login again if you wish to access the database
    * E.g. If you've added/renamed a route and would like to track the updates, you can simply hit 'Add/Rename Route', login again, and go straight to the "Track Updates" panel to update the DB.
* I've added a logout button at the bottom of the page in case the database connection is lost while the app is running (rarely happens, but when it does, the error can be found in the terminal). If you run into this error, please logout and log back in; the error will go away.
